 <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
 <p>This project is an application built to make creating, storing and publishing examinations easy for teachers and/or lecturers.</p>
 <p>Being a student at the University, I have always experienced hours of delay before I write an examination and most of them were caused by lecturers who couldn't submit their examination questions early enough to be uploaded into the CBT(Computer Based Test) Systems.</p>
<p> Asides that, lecturers were physically bound to either creating, editing and saving their examination questions on local storages like hard drives, usb drives etc, or for a few, the classic pen and paper and as such they sometimes fail to produce this documents on the said date due to some reasons and some other times the wrong document is presented.
 This I saw was also one of the factors to the issue at hand which was PORTABILITY of their questions. I set up this project with the sole aim of making it easy for them to create, edit, save and provide their questions anytime and anywhere and make it accessible over the web.</p>
 
 <h2>Project Scope</h2>
 <p>The entirety of the application is based on the CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete- Model used in building database applications in PHP.</p>
